The ocean, as an important reservoir of mercury, plays a central role in the biogeochemical cycle of Hg: monomethylmercury (CH3Hg), formed through methylation by marine microbes, is an environmental neurotoxin that can be absorbed by planktons and biomagnified through the marine food chain/web. Human exposure to CH3Hg most commonly occurs through seafood ingestion and raises serious concerns in public health. Since industrialization, the ocean has been continuously affected by anthropogenic climate change: temperature increase, ocean acidification, ecosystem diversity loss…… The transformation and bio-uptake of Hg and its compounds in the marine environment are regulated by marine biogeochemical conditions. Understanding the response of the global marine mercury cycle in the context of climate change is important for determining the future Hg-related health risks and developing regulatory strategies to reduce emissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One concern raised by climate-induced changes in the oceans is the potential increase of neurotoxic methylmercury in seafood. However, the mode of influence and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we quantified the impacts of different aspects of global climate change on the global ocean mercury cycle at the end of 21st century under a business-as-usual emission scenario by designing sensitivity analysis experiments and using cross-disciplinary methods and data from 3D marine biogeochemical models, marine ecosystem models, and Earth system models. They identified several important impact pathways in the future oceanic mercury cycle: elevated seawater temperature decreases the solubility of elemental Hg, exacerbating its escape at the air-sea interface. Weakened winds near the sea surface reduces the rate of air-sea exchange. The reduced export of particulate organic carbon reduces the sinking flux of particulate Hg, thus reducing the supply of inorganic Hg in the subsurface ocean; the reduction in productivity also reduces microbial methylation activities. They also simulated an increase in CH3Hg photodemethylation potential caused by increased incident shortwave radiation and less attenuation by decreased sea ice and chlorophyll. To sum up, this study quantitatively identifies the effects of various physical, chemical, and biological factors of climate change on marine inorganic Hg and CH3Hg concentrations and their distributions. The results offered insight into the synergisms/antagonisms in the marine Hg cycling among different climate change stressors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our research offers a broad perspective on this issue, highlighting the intricate interplay of factors, including climate dynamics and ocean ecology. These multifaceted mechanisms can either amplify or counterbalance each other, creating a complex impact in the coming century. We reveal that alterations in wind speed, rising seawater temperatures, and a reduced biological pump affect marine mercury cycling. Among these complex interactions, changes in light conditions could enhance the degradation of methylmercury, significantly reducing its presence in seawater and marine life. This, in turn, could buy us time to mitigate the release of mercury into the environment. Our results underscore the necessity of a holistic approach to studying the impact of climate change, considering both its potential benefits and detriments. This insight is valuable for guiding future policymaking, aligning it with multiple planetary boundaries, and fostering sustainable practices in a changing world.&lt;/p>
