title: "How will future climate change impact marine mercury cycling?"
summary: While climate change poses significant challenges, our research suggests that a projected decrease in oceanic methylmercury levels could reduce human exposure risks this century, providing valuable time to strengthen global mercury emission reduction efforts.

Global climate change exerts a grand challenge to human society in this century. One concern is that climate change will accelerate the formation of seawater methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin, that is accumulated by fish and eventually consumed by top predators and humans. Our study, however, shows that within a worst-case scenario devoid of additional efforts to restrain human perturbations, a projected decrease in oceanic methylmercury levels due to global climate change could buy us time. Alongside global efforts to reduce anthropogenic mercury emissions, we can effectively reduce human methylmercury exposure and the related human health risk in this century.
