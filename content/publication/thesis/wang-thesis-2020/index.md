abstract: 'Mercury (Hg) is a persistent global environmental pollutant whose organic form, methylmercury (MMHg), undergoes bioaccumulation and biomagnification within aquatic ecosystem, posing potential risks to human health. Changing ocean biogeochemistry due to climate driven changes is expected to have a large impact on marine Hg cycle. Based on the global ocean models of mercury, we conducted simulations of marine mercury cycle in the hypothesized 21st century under business-as-usual to investigate the impacts of climate change on the ocean mercury cycle. By analyzing the results of sensitivity experiments, and the quantitatively attributing the change to different factors, we found that seawater temperature and near surface wind speed alter the inorganic mercury cycle by influencing the air-sea exchange process. Downward shortwave radiation and chlorophyll concentration determine the incident shortwave radiation into the sea surface, influencing the photochemical degradation of seawater MMHg. Future changes within marine ecosystem exert a considerable impact on the formation and degradation of MMHg. OCRR(organic carbon remineralization) decides the formation of seawater MMHg. And food web structure of marine ecosystems shapes phytoplankton biogeography, influencing the uptake of MMHg.'
