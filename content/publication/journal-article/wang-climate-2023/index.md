  caption: 'Modeled effects of climate change on CH3Hg concentration in the surface (A–G) and subsurface ocean (H–N). Model results of present-day seawater CH3Hg concentration (B surface and I subsurface) and differences resulted from all factors between 2100 and present-day (G surface and N subsurface). Panels C–F and J–M are for individual factors similar to Fig. 1 in the article.'

abstract: 'Human exposure to monomethylmercury (CH$\_3$Hg), a potent neurotoxin, is principally through the consumption of seafood. The formation of CH$\_3$Hg and its bioaccumulation in marine food webs experience ongoing impacts of global climate warming and ocean biogeochemistry alterations. Employing a series of sensitivity experiments, here we explicitly consider the effects of climate change on marine mercury (Hg) cycling within a global ocean model in the hypothesized twenty-first century under the business-as-usual scenario. Even though the overall prediction is subjected to significant uncertainty, we identify several important climate change impact pathways. Elevated seawater temperature exacerbates elemental Hg (Hg0) evasion, while decreased surface wind speed reduces air-sea exchange rates. The reduced export of particulate organic carbon shrinks the pool of potentially bioavailable divalent Hg (HgII) that can be methylated in the subsurface ocean, where shallower remineralization depth associated with lower productivity causes impairment of methylation activity. We also simulate an increase in CH$\_3$Hg photodemethylation potential caused by increased incident shortwave radiation and less attenuation by decreased sea ice and chlorophyll. The model suggests that these impacts can also be propagated to the CH$\_3$Hg concentration in the base of the marine food web. Our results offer insight into synergisms/antagonisms in the marine Hg cycling among different climate change stressors.'
