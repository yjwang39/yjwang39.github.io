title: "A Revised Natural Aerosol Emission Scheme in CESM2"
event: "Dust Physical and Chemical Properties Observation and Modeling Progress Meeting"
location: "Urumqi, China"
summary: This study presents a revised natural aerosol emission scheme in CESM2, enhancing the representation of dust, sea-salt, and marine organic aerosol emissions for improved climate modeling.
abstract: This study updates CESM's aerosol schemes, focusing on dust, marine aerosol emissions. Dust emission modifications make deflation areas more continuous, improving results in North America and the subarctic. Humidity correction to sea-salt emissions has a minor effect. Introducing marine organic aerosol emissions, coupled with ocean biogeochemical processes advances CESM's aerosol modelling results.
